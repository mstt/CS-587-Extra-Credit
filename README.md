## How AI Works

Actors are able to see actors at surrounding cells up to 2 cells away. Actors can be in various states, and each state chooses a position to move to differently, either moving randomly or by evaluating a position using the actors that are in surrounding cells.

### Dodo AI

Dodos move randomly without a care in the world

### Fox AI

Foxes move randomly but avoid the edges of the world. If they see a hunter near them, they run away until they can no longer see them.

### Hunter AI

Hunters move randomly until they see prey. When they see prey, they try to keep it as close as possible until they can kill it.
